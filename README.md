## Known Bugs

_My form box didn't fit all of my text so in some cases, lengthly text was cut off. I played around with Bootstrap form styles a bit to try fixing. My current workaround was just to edit down my text. Not really a bug, but next steps would include changing the order of the answers around (making it more random) as currently they follow a pattern._
